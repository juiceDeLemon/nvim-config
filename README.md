# nvim_config
My neovim config

## Things to install before launching neovim:
- Packer (github: https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- JetBrains Mono Nerdfont (included in the source code)
- Ripgrep (github: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- pyright (github: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)
- npm (well I'm lazy and I couldn't find an npm repo)
- Go to https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/ and install the servers using npm
- if macOS: install https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/trash
## After cloning the repo:
- Please change the name from nvim-config to nvim (or whatever)
- Change the trash command in nvim-tree.lua to suit your OS
